This approach is optimal because it wouldn't rely as much on a past loan history, which most students likely haven't built out. However, there could be probabilities of loan activity and payoff history based on others' historical profiles such as their annual incomes, credit history of payments made vs. missed or levels of existing debt, or projected income based on a stated major (e.g., computer science vs. art history).\n","\n","\n","**3.

If it's the latter, then developers could very well be releasing a predatory platform that prioritizes students in dire need of loans but who have higher probabilities of having forever debt.\n",""]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"WTsbh8KeauRO"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
